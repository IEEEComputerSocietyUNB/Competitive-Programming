//Write a program that reads a number and print the Fibonacci number corresponding to this read number. Remember that the first elements of the Fibonacci series are 0 and 1 and each next term is the sum of the two preceding it. All the Fibonacci numbers calculated in this program must fit in a unsigned 64 bits number.
