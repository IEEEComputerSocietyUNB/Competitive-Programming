/*Ana and her friends are making a geometry work to school, they need to create various triangles on a chart, with a few sticks of different lengths. Soon they realized that you can not form triangles with three rods of any lengths: if one of the rods is too large relative to the other two, you can't form a triangle.

In this issue, you have to help Ana and her friends to determine if, given the
lengths of four rods, it is or not possible to select three rods, among the
four, and form a triangle.*/
