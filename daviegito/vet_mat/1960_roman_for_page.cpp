/*The ECI (Editio Chronica Incredibilis or Amazing Chronicles Editors) is very traditional when numbering the pages of its books. It always uses the Roman numerals for that. And its books never have more than 999 pages. When necessary, the books are split into volumes.

You must write a program that, given an arabic number, show its equivalent in roman numerals.

Remember that I stands for 1, V for 5, X for 10, L for 50, C for 100, D for 500
and M stands for 1000.*/
