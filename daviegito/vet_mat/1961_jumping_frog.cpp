/* In each stage of the Jumping Frog game you must safely get your amphibian through a sequence of pipes of different heights to the rightmost pipe. Nevertheless the frog just survives if the height difference of consecutive pipes is at most the frog jump height. If the next pipe height is too high, the frog hits the pipe and fall. If the next pipe height is too low, the frog does not survive the fall. The frog always starts on the top of the leftmost pipe.

In this game the distance of pipes is irrelevant, which means that the frog
always can reach the next pipe with a jump. */
